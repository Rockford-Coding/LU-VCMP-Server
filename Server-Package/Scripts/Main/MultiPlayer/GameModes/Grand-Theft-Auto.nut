/*
  Yikes!!!
  
  Extract the GTA game mode from the scripts to here. Most functions can be found by typing "GTA_" in the search bar.
  Recode most base functions. The game mode was manually scripted as an entry, but this was a piss poor method. 
  I'm sure there are a lot of functions for the GTA Game mode that we could use for the server, Or, any other game mode 
  that could use it as wll.
